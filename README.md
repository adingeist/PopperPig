        Popper pig is a fun, hyper-casual arcade game. You control your pig through the air trying to pop as many balloons as possible. Hold your touch on the screen to raise or release to lower. The better you do, the more intense it gets. The game gets faster and faster. If you let too many balloons past you, it's game over! The highest score is saved in persistent storage as a JSON object.

# Gameplay and Walkthrough of the Design

Watch on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk9at0VvZZo">YouTube</a>.

# Cool! How'd you do this?
I wrote the application in Python and used the Kivy package. Kivy allowed to me to manipulate objects on the screen with ease, test the build on my desktop, and export the project to an Android APK. I was then able to sign my APK and publish it on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.graapl.popperpig.popperpig">Google Play Store</a>. I encourage you to check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk9at0VvZZo">15-minute presentation I made</a> where I explain the mechanics and strategies I used coding to develop the game.

# How to play

It's easy! Tap and hold on your device to raise the pig. Release you touch to lower the pig. If you miss too many balloons or go out of bounds, it's game over!
